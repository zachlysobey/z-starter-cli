# Contributing guide

I'd welcome any input / ctriticism / contributions, but don't really expect any lol.

Feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/zachlysobey/z-starter-cli/issues/new) or [a PR](https://github.com/zachlysobey/z-starter-cli/pulls) here, or find my contact info and reach out.
I'm the only Zach Lysobey in the world, so it shouldn't be that tough to track me down.
